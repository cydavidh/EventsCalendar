Concepts and Practices used/practiced in the project:

- N-tiered Architecture
- Jpa/Hibernate: entityManager (used Repository/spring data jpa before so I thought I'd practice this instead)
- PersistenceContext
- Transactional
- queries with JPQL
- exception handling with global exception handler
- Hibernate Validator (Bean validation with @Valid)
- setup for Oracle Database
- integration test with H2 database
- unit test with Junit and mockito.
- Restful Api
